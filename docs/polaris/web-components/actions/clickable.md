# Clickable

The clickable component wraps content to make it interactive and clickable. Use it when you need more styling control than [button](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/actions/button) or [link](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/actions/link) provide, such as custom backgrounds, padding, or borders around your clickable content.

Clickable supports button, link, and submit modes with built-in accessibility properties for keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

#### Use cases

* **Custom interactive areas:** Create clickable areas without button styling for cards or panels.
* **Interactive content:** Make text, images, or complex layouts clickable while preserving appearance.
* **Subtle interactions:** Implement interactions where button styling would be too prominent.
* **Custom navigation:** Build custom navigation elements with click handlers.

```html
<s-clickable borderRadius="base" padding="base" border="base">
  <s-text>View order details</s-text>
</s-clickable>
```

## Properties

Configure the following properties on the clickable component.

* **accessibility​Label**

  **string**

  A label that describes the purpose or content of the component for assistive technologies like screen readers. Use this to provide additional context when the visible content alone doesn't clearly convey the component's purpose.

* **accessibility​Role**

  **AccessibilityRole**

  **Default: 'generic'**

  The semantic meaning of the component’s content. When set, the role will be used by assistive technologies to help users navigate the page.

* **accessibility​Visibility**

  **"visible" | "hidden" | "exclusive"**

  **Default: 'visible'**

  The visibility mode of the element for both visual and assistive technology users.

  * `visible`: The element is visible to all users (both sighted users and screen readers).
  * `hidden`: The element is visually visible but hidden from screen readers. Use this for decorative elements that don't provide meaningful information.
  * `exclusive`: The element is visually hidden but announced by screen readers. Use this for screen-reader-only content like skip links or additional context.

* **background**

  **BackgroundColorKeyword**

  **Default: 'transparent'**

  The background color of the component.

* **block​Size**

  **SizeUnitsOrAuto**

  **Default: 'auto'**

  The vertical size of the element in standard layouts (height in left-to-right or right-to-left writing modes).

  Block size adjusts based on the writing direction: in horizontal layouts, it controls the height; in vertical layouts, it controls the width. This ensures consistent behavior across different text directions.

  Learn more about [block-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size).

* **border**

  **BorderShorthand**

  **Default: 'none'**

  A border applied using shorthand syntax to specify width, color, and style in a single property.

* **border​Color**

  **"" | ColorKeyword**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The color of the border using the design system's color scale. When set, this overrides the color value specified in the `border` property.

* **border​Radius**

  **MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty\<BoxBorderRadii>**

  **Default: 'none'**

  The roundedness of the element's corners using the design system's radius scale.

* **border​Style**

  **"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty\<BoxBorderStyles>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The visual style of the border on all sides, such as solid, dashed, or dotted. When set, this overrides the style value specified in the `border` property.

* **border​Width**

  **"" | MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty<"small" | "small-100" | "base" | "large" | "large-100" | "none">**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The thickness of the border on all sides. When set, this overrides the width value specified in the `border` property.

* **command**

  **'--auto' | '--show' | '--hide' | '--toggle'**

  **Default: '--auto'**

  The action that [command](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#command) should take when this component is activated.

  * `--auto`: A default action for the target component.
  * `--show`: Shows the target component.
  * `--hide`: Hides the target component.
  * `--toggle`: Toggles the visibility of the target component.

* **command​For**

  **string**

  The component that [commandFor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#commandfor) should act on when this component is activated.

* **disabled**

  **boolean**

  Whether the component is disabled, preventing clicks and focus. When disabled, the `click` event won't fire and click events from child elements stop propagating immediately. Interactive child elements can still receive focus and be interacted with. This doesn't apply visual styling by default. You should apply disabled styling as needed.

* **display**

  **MaybeResponsive<"auto" | "none">**

  **Default: 'auto'**

  The outer [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) type of the component. The outer type sets a component's participation in [flow layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout).

  * `auto` the component's initial value. The actual value depends on the component and context.
  * `none` hides the component from display and removes it from the accessibility tree, making it invisible to screen readers.

* **download**

  **string**

  Prompts the browser to download the linked URL rather than navigate to it. When set, the value specifies the suggested filename for the downloaded file.

  The filename suggestion is only respected for same-origin URLs, `blob:`, and `data:` schemes. Cross-origin URLs can still trigger downloads, but browsers might ignore the suggested filename.

  Learn more about the [download attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#download).

* **href**

  **string**

  The URL to navigate to when clicked. The `click` event fires first, then navigation occurs. If `commandFor` is also set, the command executes instead of navigation.

* **inline​Size**

  **SizeUnitsOrAuto**

  **Default: 'auto'**

  The width in horizontal writing modes, or height in vertical writing modes. Use this for flow-relative sizing that adapts to text direction. Learn more about [inline-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size).

* **interest​For**

  **string**

  The ID of the component to show when users hover over or focus on this component. Use this to connect interactive components to popovers or tooltips that provide additional context or information.

* **loading**

  **boolean**

  Whether the component is in a loading state, which indicates to assistive technology that an action is in progress and prevents interaction.

* **max​Block​Size**

  **SizeUnitsOrNone**

  **Default: 'none'**

  The maximum height in horizontal writing modes, or maximum width in vertical writing modes. Prevents the element from growing beyond this size.

  Learn more about [max-block-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-block-size).

* **max​Inline​Size**

  **SizeUnitsOrNone**

  **Default: 'none'**

  The maximum width in horizontal writing modes, or maximum height in vertical writing modes. Prevents the element from growing beyond this size.

  Learn more about [max-inline-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size).

* **min​Block​Size**

  **SizeUnits**

  **Default: '0'**

  The minimum height in horizontal writing modes, or minimum width in vertical writing modes. Prevents the element from shrinking below this size.

  Learn more about [min-block-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-block-size).

* **min​Inline​Size**

  **SizeUnits**

  **Default: '0'**

  The minimum width in horizontal writing modes, or minimum height in vertical writing modes. Prevents the element from shrinking below this size.

  Learn more about [min-inline-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size).

* **overflow**

  **"visible" | "hidden"**

  **Default: 'visible'**

  The overflow behavior of the element.

  * `visible`: the content that extends beyond the element’s container is visible.
  * `hidden`: clips the content when it is larger than the element’s container. The element will not be scrollable and the users will not be able to access the clipped content by dragging or using a scroll wheel on a mouse.

* **padding**

  **MaybeResponsive\<MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty\<PaddingKeyword>>**

  **Default: 'none'**

  The padding applied to all edges of the component.

  Supports [1-to-4-value syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#edges_of_a_box) using flow-relative values:

  * 1 value applies to all sides
  * 2 values apply to block (top/bottom) and inline (left/right)
  * 3 values apply to block-start (top), inline (left/right), and block-end (bottom)
  * 4 values apply to block-start (top), inline-end (right), block-end (bottom), and inline-start (left)

  **Examples:** `base`, `large none`, `base large-100 base small`

  Use `auto` to inherit padding from the nearest container with removed padding. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Block**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty\<PaddingKeyword>>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The block-direction padding (top and bottom in horizontal writing modes).

  Accepts a single value for both sides or two space-separated values for block-start and block-end.

  **Example:** `large none` applies `large` to the top and `none` to the bottom.

  Overrides the block value from `padding`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Block​End**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The block-end padding (bottom in horizontal writing modes).

  Overrides the block-end value from `paddingBlock`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Block​Start**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The block-start padding (top in horizontal writing modes).

  Overrides the block-start value from `paddingBlock`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Inline**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | MaybeTwoValuesShorthandProperty\<PaddingKeyword>>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The inline-direction padding (left and right in horizontal writing modes).

  Accepts a single value for both sides or two space-separated values for inline-start and inline-end.

  **Example:** `large none` applies `large` to the left and `none` to the right.

  Overrides the inline value from `padding`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Inline​End**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The inline-end padding (right in LTR writing modes, left in RTL).

  Overrides the inline-end value from `paddingInline`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **padding​Inline​Start**

  **MaybeResponsive<"" | PaddingKeyword>**

  **Default: '' - meaning no override**

  The inline-start padding (left in LTR writing modes, right in RTL).

  Overrides the inline-start value from `paddingInline`. Also accepts a [responsive value](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#responsive-values) string with the supported `PaddingKeyword` as a query value.

* **target**

  **"auto" | AnyString | "\_blank" | "\_self" | "\_parent" | "\_top"**

  **Default: 'auto'**

  The browsing context where the linked URL should be displayed.

  * `auto`: The target is automatically determined based on the origin of the URL.
  * `_blank`: Opens the URL in a new window or tab.
  * `_self`: Opens the URL in the same browsing context as the current one.
  * `_parent`: Opens the URL in the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, behaves as `_self`.
  * `_top`: Opens the URL in the topmost browsing context (the highest ancestor of the current one). If there is no ancestor, behaves as `_self`.

* **type**

  **"button" | "reset" | "submit"**

  **Default: 'button'**

  The behavior of the button component.

  * `button`: Used to indicate the component acts as a button, meaning it has no default action.
  * `reset`: Used to indicate the component acts as a reset button, meaning it resets the closest form (returning fields to their default values).
  * `submit`: Used to indicate the component acts as a submit button, meaning it submits the closest form.

  This property is ignored if the component supports `href` or `commandFor`/`command` and one of them is set.

### AccessibilityRole

Defines the semantic role of a component for assistive technologies like screen readers. Accessibility roles help users with disabilities understand the purpose and structure of content. These roles map to HTML elements and ARIA roles, providing semantic meaning beyond visual presentation. Use these roles to: - Improve navigation for screen reader users - Provide semantic structure to your UI - Ensure proper interpretation by assistive technologies Learn more about \[ARIA roles]\(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) in the MDN web docs. - \`main\`: Indicates the primary content area of the page. - \`header\`: Marks a component as a header containing introductory content or navigation. - \`footer\`: Designates content containing information like copyright, navigation links, or privacy statements. - \`section\`: Defines a generic thematic grouping of content that should have a heading or accessible label. - \`aside\`: Marks supporting content that relates to but is separate from the main content. - \`navigation\`: Identifies major groups of navigation links for moving around the site or page. - \`ordered-list\`: Represents a list where the order of items is meaningful. - \`list-item\`: Identifies an individual item within a list. - \`list-item-separator\`: Acts as a visual and semantic divider between items in a list. - \`unordered-list\`: Represents a list where the order of items is not meaningful. - \`separator\`: Creates a divider that separates and distinguishes sections of content. - \`status\`: Defines a live region for advisory information that is not urgent enough to be an alert. - \`alert\`: Marks important, time-sensitive information that requires the user's immediate attention. - \`generic\`: Creates a semantically neutral container element with no inherent meaning. - \`presentation\`: Removes semantic meaning from an element while preserving its visual appearance. - \`none\`: Synonym for \`presentation\`, removes semantic meaning while keeping visual styling.

```ts
'main' | 'header' | 'footer' | 'section' | 'region' | 'aside' | 'navigation' | 'ordered-list' | 'list-item' | 'list-item-separator' | 'unordered-list' | 'separator' | 'status' | 'alert' | 'generic' | 'presentation' | 'none'

```ts
'subdued' | 'base' | 'strong'
```

### SizeUnitsOrAuto

Represents size values that can also be set to \`auto\` for automatic sizing. - \`SizeUnits\`: Specific size values in pixels, percentages, or zero for precise control. - \`auto\`: Automatically sizes based on content and layout constraints.

```ts
SizeUnits | 'auto'
```

### SizeUnits

Represents size values in pixels, percentages, or zero. - \`${number}px\`: Absolute size in pixels for fixed dimensions (such as \`100px\`, \`24px\`). - \`${number}%\`: Relative size as a percentage of the parent container (such as \`50%\`, \`100%\`). - \`0\`: Zero size, equivalent to no dimension.

```ts
`${number}px` | `${number}%` | `0`
```

### BorderShorthand

Represents a shorthand for defining a border. It can be a combination of size, optionally followed by color, optionally followed by style.

```ts
BorderSizeKeyword | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword}` | `${BorderSizeKeyword} ${ColorKeyword} ${BorderStyleKeyword}`
```

### BorderSizeKeyword

Defines the width of borders, using the standard size scale or \`none\` for no border. - \`SizeKeyword\`: Standard border widths from the size scale for consistent thickness. - \`none\`: No border width (removes the border).

```

### MaybeAllValuesShorthandProperty

Represents CSS shorthand properties that accept one to four values. Supports specifying values for all four sides: top, right, bottom, and left. - \`T\`: Single value that applies to all four sides. - \`${T} ${T}\`: Two values for block axis (top/bottom) and inline axis (left/right). - \`${T} ${T} ${T}\`: Three values for block-start (top), inline axis (left/right), and block-end (bottom). - \`${T} ${T} ${T} ${T}\`: Four values for block-start (top), inline-end (right), block-end (bottom), and inline-start (left).

```ts

```ts
'auto' | 'none' | 'solid' | 'dashed'
```

### MaybeResponsive

Makes a property responsive by allowing it to be set conditionally based on container query conditions. The value can be either a base value or a container query string. - \`T\`: Base value that applies in all conditions. - \`@container${string}\`: Container query string for conditional responsive styling based on container size.

```ts
T | `@container${string}`
```

### SizeUnitsOrNone

```ts
T | `${T} ${T}`
```

### AnyString

A utility type that enables autocomplete for specific string literals while still accepting any string value. By intersecting \`string\` with an empty object type, this prevents TypeScript from widening literal types, preserving IDE suggestions for known values while maintaining flexibility for custom strings.

```ts
string & {}
```

### Events

The clickable component provides event callbacks for handling user interactions. Learn more about [handling events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#handling-events).

* **blur**

  **CallbackEventListener\<typeof tagName> | null**

  A callback fired when the component loses focus.

  Learn more about the [blur event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event).

* **click**

  **CallbackEventListener\<typeof tagName> | null**

  A callback fired when the component is clicked.

  Learn more about the [click event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event).

* **focus**

  **CallbackEventListener\<typeof tagName> | null**

  A callback fired when the component receives focus.

  Learn more about the [focus event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event).

### CallbackEventListener

A function that handles events from UI components. This type represents an event listener callback that receives a \`CallbackEvent\` with a strongly-typed \`currentTarget\`. Use this for component event handlers like \`click\`, \`focus\`, \`blur\`, and other DOM events.

```ts
(EventListener & {
      (event: CallbackEvent<T>): void;
    }) | null
```

### CallbackEvent

An event object with a strongly-typed \`currentTarget\` property that references the specific HTML element that triggered the event. This type extends the standard DOM \`Event\` interface and ensures type safety when accessing the element that fired the event.

```ts
Event & {
  currentTarget: HTMLElementTagNameMap[T];
}
```

### Slots

The clickable component supports slots for additional content placement within the component. Learn more about [using slots](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/polaris/using-polaris-web-components#slots).

* **children**

  **HTMLElement**

  The content displayed within the clickable component, which makes any content interactive and clickable without the semantic meaning of a button or link.

## Examples

### Create a custom interactive element

Build custom interactive elements with flexible styling that [button](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/actions/button) or [link](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/actions/link) don't support. This example shows two clickable elements with different background and border styles.

## html

```html
<s-clickable padding="base">Create Store</s-clickable>


<s-clickable
  border="base"
  padding="base"
  background="subdued"
  borderRadius="base"
>
  View Shipping Settings
</s-clickable>
```

### Navigate to a URL

Set the `href` property to make a clickable element navigate like a link. This example shows a clickable component that opens a URL in a new browser tab.

## html

```html
<s-clickable href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">
  Visit Shopify
</s-clickable>
```

### Create a form submit button

Use a clickable component as a form submit button with a disabled state to prevent premature submission. This example shows a disabled submit-type clickable component with a border and padding.

## html

```html
<s-clickable type="submit" disabled border="base" padding="base">
  Save changes
</s-clickable>
```

### Add a clickable action to a section

Add a clickable button alongside descriptive content in a section. This example shows a styled clickable button inside a box with a heading and description.

## html

```html
<s-box padding="large-400" background="base" borderRadius="small-200">
  <s-stack gap="large-300">
    <s-heading>Product settings</s-heading>
    <s-text>Configure your product inventory and pricing settings.</s-text>
    <s-clickable background="base" padding="base" borderRadius="small">
      <s-text type="strong">Configure settings</s-text>
    </s-clickable>
  </s-stack>
</s-box>
```

### Add an accessibility label

Add an accessibility label to provide screen readers with more context than the visible text alone. This example shows a clickable delete button with a descriptive label for assistive technologies.

## html

```html
<s-clickable
  accessibilityLabel="Delete product winter collection jacket"
  background="base"
  padding="base"
  borderRadius="small"
>
  <s-text>Delete</s-text>
</s-clickable>
```

### Describe a disabled link with an accessibility label

Disable a clickable link while providing an accessibility label that explains why the feature is unavailable. This example shows a disabled navigation element with a descriptive label for screen readers.

## html

```html
<s-clickable
  href="javascript:void(0)"
  disabled
  accessibilityLabel="This link is currently unavailable"
>
  <s-text>Unavailable feature</s-text>
</s-clickable>
```

***

## Best practices

* **Provide accessibility labels:** Always include `accessibilityLabel` for elements without visible text to ensure screen reader users understand the element's purpose.
* **Choose appropriate modes:** Use button mode for triggering actions, link mode for navigation, and submit mode for form submissions.
* **Indicate disabled state:** When disabling clickable elements, provide clear visual feedback and explanatory text about why the element's unavailable.
