# Account connection

Many apps integrate with external services like marketing platforms, sales channels, or analytics providers. The account connection composition gives merchants a clear interface to connect or disconnect these integrations.

Display connection status, the connected account name, and provide actions to connect or disconnect. Place this composition in your settings or on a dedicated integrations page.

## Examples

### Display connection status with connect button and terms

Merchants need to connect or disconnect external services (e.g. marketing platforms, sales channels) from your app. This pattern displays account connection layout with a connect button and terms. The [grid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/layout-and-structure/grid) aligns account information and button, the [section](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/layout-and-structure/section) provides padding, and the terms text below describes the connection agreement.

```tsx
<s-section>
  <s-stack gap="base">
    <s-grid gridTemplateColumns="1fr auto" gap="base" alignItems="center">
      <s-grid-item>
