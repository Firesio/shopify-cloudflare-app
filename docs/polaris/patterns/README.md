# Patterns

Most apps include common pages like landing and settings pages, which appear in the App Home iframe. There are two types of patterns you should used to build those pages:

* **Templates:** Full page patterns for common Shopify app pages.
* **Compositions:** Smaller groupings of web components and APIs that solve specific tasks in your pages.

Each of the patterns below combines web components and APIs into performant layouts that most apps need while satisfying [Built for Shopify requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/built-for-shopify/requirements) out of the box.

## Templates

Templates are full-page layouts for paths and functionality found in most Shopify apps. Use one as your starting point so your app feels familiar in Shopify admin and meets merchant expectations for navigation, spacing, and interaction.

## Compositions

Compositions solve specific interface challenges like displaying data tables or guiding merchants through setup. A page of your app (as seen in the templates above) will often be composed of many of these kinds of common compositions.

Combinations of web components and APIs are provided here as compositions so that you can quickly add functionality without reinventing useful patterns.
