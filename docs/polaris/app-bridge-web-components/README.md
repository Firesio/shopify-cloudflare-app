# App Bridge web components

**Info:**

App Bridge isn't versioned with Polaris. App Bridge APIs and web components are identical in every App Home reference version.

While [Web components](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components) build the UI inside your app's iframe, App Bridge web components control parts of the Shopify admin that surround it. Use them to add navigation menus, configure page titles, and manage save bar behavior so your app feels native to merchants.

### Adding App Bridge web components to your app

When you scaffold your app using [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli), the App Bridge library is added to your app automatically. You can also manually add App Bridge in any framework by adding the following script tag to your app's HTML head:

##### HTML

```html
<head>
  <meta name="shopify-api-key" content="%SHOPIFY_API_KEY%" />
  <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js"></script>
</head>
```

##### Remix

```tsx
// app/root.tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta name="shopify-api-key" content="%SHOPIFY_API_KEY%" />
        <script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js" />
      </head>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For TypeScript users, Shopify provides a companion npm library for App Bridge types, available at [`@shopify/app-bridge-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/app-bridge-types). You can install this library in your project using `yarn` or `npm`. Loading App Bridge in your app from [cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js](https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js) installs the latest version of the library. To keep your types in step, specify `@shopify/app-bridge-types@latest` in your `package.json` file.
