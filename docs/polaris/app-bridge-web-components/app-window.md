# App window

**Info:**

App Bridge isn't versioned with Polaris. App Bridge APIs and web components are identical in every App Home reference version.

The app window component displays a fullscreen modal window for complex workflows that need dedicated screen space. The content is specified by the `src` property and should point to a route within your app. The app window covers the entire screen, with a top bar controlled by the Shopify admin that allows users to exit.

For most dialogs, we recommend using the [Polaris modal component](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/web-components/overlays/modal), which automatically determines whether the modal should display inside your app or as a fullscreen overlay and removes the need for separate App Bridge API control.

#### Use cases

* **Complex workflows:** Display fullscreen modal windows for multi-step workflows that need dedicated screen space.
* **Isolated views:** Load a separate route within your app in a fullscreen overlay for focused tasks.
* **Extended forms:** Present complex forms or configuration interfaces that benefit from full-screen real estate.
* **Content previews:** Show rich content previews or editing interfaces in a distraction-free fullscreen view.

***

## Properties

Attributes for the app window element. This element displays a fullscreen modal window in the Shopify admin.

* **src**

  **string**

  **required**

  The URL of the content to display within the app window. Must point to a route within your app that renders the window content. The URL is loaded in an iframe when the window opens. Commonly used for multi-step workflows, bulk editors, or detailed views that need full-screen space.

* **id**

  **string**

  A unique identifier you assign to the app window element. Used when connecting buttons via `commandFor` or accessing the element with `document.getElementById()`. Choose a descriptive name like `"settings-window"` or `"edit-modal"`.

***

## Instance methods

Instance properties and methods available on the app window element for programmatic control.

* **add​Event​Listener**

  **(type: "show" | "hide", listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject) => void**

  Adds an event listener for app window lifecycle events. Supported events: `show` fires when the window opens, `hide` fires when the window closes. Commonly used for tracking analytics, updating UI state, or cleaning up resources when the window closes.

* **content​Window**

  **Window | null**

  Returns the Window object of the app window iframe, or `null` if the window is closed. Use this to communicate with the iframe content via `postMessage()` or access its document. Only accessible when the app window is open.

* **hide**

  **() => Promise\<void>**

  Closes the app window. Returns a Promise that resolves when the window is fully hidden. Any unsaved changes in forms with `data-save-bar` will prompt the user before closing. Commonly used for programmatic close after completing a workflow.

* **remove​Event​Listener**

  **(type: "show" | "hide", listener: EventListenerOrEventListenerObject) => void**

  Removes a previously added event listener. Pass the same event type and listener function that was used with `addEventListener()`. Commonly used for cleanup when a component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

* **show**

  **() => Promise\<void>**

  Opens the app window and displays the content from the `src` URL. Returns a Promise that resolves when the window is fully visible. Use `await` or `.then()` to run code after the window opens. Commonly used for launching workflows triggered by user actions.

* **src**

  **string**

  Gets or sets the URL of the content displayed in the app window. Changing this value while the window is open navigates to the new URL. Commonly used for dynamic navigation within an open window.

* **toggle**

  **() => Promise\<void>**

  Toggles the app window between open and closed states. Returns a Promise that resolves when the transition completes. Opens the window if closed, closes it if open. Commonly used for toggle buttons that control window visibility.

## Examples

  </form>
</s-page>
```

## Best practices

* **Open only via explicit user action**: Launch app windows from buttons that clearly indicate a fullscreen experience will open. Never open automatically on page load.
* **Set descriptive titles**: Use the [page component](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/app-bridge-web-components/title-bar) inside your app window content to set a heading that clearly describes the current task.
* **Handle unsaved changes**: Add `data-save-bar` to forms to automatically prompt merchants before they exit with unsaved changes. See [Save Bar API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-home/latest/apis/user-interface-and-interactions/save-bar-api).
* **Return to context on close**: Ensure closing the app window returns merchants to where they started. Don't navigate them elsewhere unexpectedly.
