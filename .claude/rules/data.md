# Data access

D1 is a network hop per query and the app is multi-tenant. Both are binding.

## Shop-scoped, always

Every table carries `shop`. Every `where` includes it. Every model function takes
`shop` as its **first explicit parameter** — `findById(shop, id)`, never
`findById(id)`. An id from a form or URL is attacker-controlled.

A query that can read or write another shop's row is a **security defect**.
`@rules/testing.md` requires a test proving it cannot — part of the feature, not
a follow-up.

**Two tables are not shop-scoped:** `admin_users` (our staff) and
`redacted_shops` (the redaction tombstone: `shop_hash` + `redacted_at`, nothing
that identifies the shop). The tombstone is written in the same D1 batch as the
purge and read by every path that could recreate a shop (Partner history,
webhook intake, sweeps); only the merchant's own reinstall (`afterAuth`) clears
it. Its model is keyed by hash, so the cross-shop test proves one hash never
suppresses another.

## Never one query per row

A query inside `.map()`, `for`, or `forEach` over rows you just fetched is a
defect. Batch with `inArray(...)` and group in memory, **preserving the query's
`ORDER BY`** so per-parent ordering matches.

Cost scales with the largest merchant, not the fixture. In production the tell is
`wallTimeMs` orders of magnitude above `cpuTimeMs` — that is round trips, not
slow code.

## Migrations are forward-only

Once applied to production, never edit, rename, or renumber a migration — a new
one fixes a bad one. Migrations are generated (`npm run db:generate`), never
hand-written, and the filename is the applied key. Adding a column is safe;
removing one is two deploys (stop reading, then drop). Any change under
`app/db/` or `drizzle/` runs the **full** suite: a migration breaks tests that
never mention it.

## Money columns are INTEGER

`real()` is banned. D1 is SQLite, `REAL` is an IEEE-754 double, and SQLite has no
fixed-point decimal type — so integer minor units is the only safe
representation. Use `money("total")` from `~/db/columns`, which emits
`total_amount INTEGER` + `total_currency TEXT`. Full contract: @rules/money.md.

## Failure boundaries

Independent panels fail independently with a sensible empty value **and a logged
event** — never `catch {}`, never a blank page from one bad query.

**Degrade decoration. Never degrade correctness.** A count, a badge, or a
secondary panel may fall back to an empty value. Anything the page cannot be
correct without — an amount, a total, an entitlement, a status the merchant will
act on — fails loudly instead of rendering a plausible wrong number.

## Drizzle-only queries

All application database reads and writes use schema-backed Drizzle builders
(`select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, joins, predicates, aggregates, conflict
clauses, and transactions). Raw SQL strings, `D1Database.prepare()`,
`db.run(sql\`...\`)`, `sql.raw()`, and hand-written SQL are forbidden in
`app/**/*.ts` production code. This rule applies to atomic guards and schema
introspection too: model the operation with Drizzle transactions, conflict
clauses, and typed schema metadata. Queries must remain bounded and indexed under
heavy use: avoid per-row queries, select only required columns, constrain every
query by tenant, and add/verify indexes for hot predicates. Never split a guard
and its write into separate application-level queries.
