# Cloudflare Workers

## The service list — closed by default

In scope means *allowed*, not *already wired*. Declare a binding when a feature
needs it; do not scaffold one speculatively.

| Service | Used for | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Workers** | The app (SSR) + webhooks | One Worker, one deployed env |
| **Static Assets** | Client bundle | The `assets` binding — not Pages |
| **D1** | All relational state | `@rules/data.md` |
| **KV** | Shopify sessions + hot read cache | Eventually consistent — never the source of relational truth. Shop-scoped keys, invalidate at the write site |
| **Queues** | Webhook → pipeline handoff | At-least-once ⇒ idempotent consumers, backoff that spans an outage (not a minute), and a **dead-letter queue**. A webhook route answers 2xx only after ONE `queue.send` and writes nothing to D1 first (`docs/webhooks.md`). `message.attempts` starts at 1: pass it through unchanged |
| **Cron Triggers** | Periodic sweeps | One `scheduled` handler; each sweep guards its own errors so one failure never costs the others their tick |
| **Email Sending** | Transactional email | Verified sender domain from `vars`; failures leave a retryable record |
| **Rate Limiting** | Runaway clients / webhook floods | Config-only binding, fails open when absent |
| **Observability** | Logs | `enabled: true` + `head_sampling_rate`, structured JSON |
| **Workers AI** | Text generation behind a chosen model | Binding only — no API key exists to leak. Every call goes through the port in `app/ports/ai.ts`, is metered into `ai_runs`, and names a ROLE rather than a model id |

**Everything else is out of scope until a written reason says otherwise** —
Durable Objects, Hyperdrive, Vectorize, Browser Rendering, Images,
Stream, Containers, Analytics Engine, service bindings, Workers for Platforms.
Adding a binding is an architecture decision, not a convenience — write down
*why* in the same change.

**Workers AI moved IN SCOPE**, and here is the written reason. Support staff
answer the same questions repeatedly, and a draft they edit is faster than a
reply they compose; drafting is also the safest possible first AI surface,
because a human reads every word before a merchant does. Workers AI rather than
a hosted provider because it is a BINDING: no API key to store, rotate or leak,
no egress, and it bills on the same account as everything else. The AI SDK
(`ai` + `workers-ai-provider`) sits behind our own port, so swapping to a hosted
model later is an adapter change and nothing above it moves.

The constraints that come with it:

- **No model id is ever hardcoded in a feature.** A caller names a ROLE
  (`writing`, `summary`); which model serves that role is a row in `ai_models`,
  chosen from a catalogue in the internal console. A typo'd or retired id
  resolves to nothing at call time, which reads as a broken feature rather than
  a bad setting — hence a select, never a text field.
- **Every call is metered.** One `ai_runs` row per call, with tokens and
  latency, because tokens are what cost money and an unmetered AI surface is an
  unbounded bill.
- **AI is decoration, never correctness.** A failed or absent model degrades the
  feature to "no draft"; it must never block a reply being sent
  (@rules/data.md).

**The two extension points, and what they cost.** The base is deliberately
policy-free; both seams below are where an app adds its own.

- **A new AI feature is one file.** `defineAiTask` for prose or
  `defineAiObjectTask` for a value of a known shape (`app/ai/task.ts`) — name the
  purpose it needs, name itself for the ledger, turn its input into messages —
  then `run` / `runObject` / `stream` on `AiService`. It inherits the gate, the
  fallback chain, health tracking, metering and streaming, because none of those
  are a feature's job. An object task's Zod schema is sent to the model as JSON
  Schema AND validated on the way back, and a wrong shape falls through to the
  next model rather than reaching the caller. `app/ai/task.test.ts` asserts all
  of this: if adding a task ever needs a change to the service, adapter, gate or
  ledger, that test fails and the base has stopped being extensible.
- **Ports are bound in `app/wiring.server.ts`, nowhere else.** A use case
  declares a port and receives an implementation; it must never import an
  adapter (@rules/architecture.md). Swapping the provider, or the gating policy,
  is a line in that file.
- **Gating is composed, not built in.** `app/ai/gate.ts` ships `allowAll` and
  `composeGates`; the base contains no notion of a plan or a quota, because those
  differ per app and a base that guesses makes every app delete code first. An
  app writes one `AiGate` and names it in its composition root. `merchantsOnly`
  wraps a policy so our own console is never gated by a merchant's plan — the
  mistake that otherwise breaks the support desk on a downgrade.

Two calls that recur and deserve a recorded answer rather than a reflex:

- **Queues vs Workflows.** Queues fit enqueue-and-forget single steps.
  **Workflows** fit multi-step processes where each step must survive failure
  independently. Pick per pipeline, and say which and why.
- **R2** only once blobs actually exist. Nothing needs it by default.

## Limits that change the design

- **128 MB per isolate** → stream bodies (`response.body`, `TransformStream`);
  never `await response.text()` on unbounded data.
- **CPU 30s default** (raisable), **15 min wall** for queue/cron consumers, but
  **`waitUntil` only ~30s** → long work belongs in a Queue, never in
  `waitUntil`.
- **Subrequests are capped per invocation, and only ~6 connections may wait on
  headers at once** → never one Shopify or D1 call per row. Batch, or move the
  fan-out into a consumer.
- **10 MB compressed script** → no bundling a library you use one function of.

## Config

- **`wrangler.jsonc`**, not TOML — newer platform features are JSON-only.
- `compatibility_date` current, `nodejs_compat` enabled (AsyncLocalStorage for
  the request context).
- **`wrangler types` generates `Env`. Never hand-write a binding interface** — it
  drifts from config silently.
- **Named-env bindings are NOT inherited.** Every binding, `var`, trigger, and
  observability block is re-declared under the production env. A forgotten one is
  *absent* in production, not inherited. `main`, `compatibility_date`,
  `compatibility_flags` and `assets` are the exceptions that DO inherit.
- **A placeholder id must never survive into a deployed env.** The top-level
  config is local dev (Miniflare simulates bindings by name and ignores ids), so
  those ids are deliberately fake. Check the real ones are in the production env
  before deploying.
- Secrets via `wrangler secret put` / Secrets Store, **never** in config or
  source. Public config (domains, scopes, client id) lives in `vars`, committed on
  purpose, so a domain move is a config edit and nothing in `app/` holds a
  hostname.
- `custom_domain: true` when the Worker is the origin.

## Runtime invariants

- **Bindings, never the Cloudflare REST API** from inside a Worker.
- **Never destructure `ctx`** (`const { waitUntil } = ctx`) — it loses `this` and
  throws *Illegal invocation* at runtime.
- **No floating promises.** Every promise is awaited, returned, or handed to
  `ctx.waitUntil()`. `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` is the gate.
- **No module-level mutable state** — an isolate is reused across shops
  (`@rules/architecture.md`).
- **`env` / `getEnv()`, never `process.env`** — workerd does not populate it.
- All three surfaces — `fetch`, `queue`, `scheduled` — wrap work in the request
  context so `getDb()`/`getEnv()` resolve.
- **`crypto.getRandomValues()` / `crypto.randomUUID()`, never `Math.random()`**
  for anything security-bearing. Compare Shopify webhook HMACs with
  `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` — never `===`.
- **No `passThroughOnException`.** Explicit `try/catch` and a structured error
  response.

## Deploy

`npm run cf:deploy` is the whole path: **verify → production build → D1
migrations → deploy**, in that order. Migrations land *before* the worker, so
code never runs ahead of its schema.

**Build and deploy are one command on purpose. Never split them.**
`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` resolves the environment at **build** time and bakes it
into `build/server/wrangler.json`. `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production` during the build
is what selects the production env — `wrangler deploy --env production` on a dev
build silently ignores the flag and ships localhost vars with placeholder
binding ids. This is a real, reproducible failure, not a theoretical one.

**npm is the only package manager.** A CI builder picks its installer from the
lockfiles it finds, so a stray `yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` silently changes
the build.

**Migration filenames are the applied key** (`d1_migrations` records them by
name). Never rename or renumber an applied migration; forward-only, always.
