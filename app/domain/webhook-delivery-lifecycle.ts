 * go: `shop/redact` purges the shop, so "the shop row is gone" must not make it a no-op (the delivery row is the
 * proof that Shopify asked), and the compliance topics are owed an answer even for a shop this app never recorded.
 *
 * `onUnknownShop` is OUR policy (not Shopify's) for a topic that needs the row when the shop is not tombstoned and has
 * no row yet - a webhook can overtake the first embedded load that creates it. `run`: the handler's own ordering
 * decision is a correct no-op (an uninstall of a shop never recorded has nothing to undo, and a row created later is
 * newer than it). `defer`: dropping it would lose a fact the row will want (the complete scope set), so it is retried
 * until the row exists or the attempts run out.
