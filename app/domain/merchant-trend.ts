/**
 * The three merchant numbers the internal dashboard charts. The counting is
 * done by the database (`ShopMetricsRepo.installTrend`) in a single aggregate
 * scan; this module owns the calendar — which months, where each starts and
 * ends — and the assembly of the result.
 *
 * Replaces `installsByMonth`, which answered only "how many installed this
 * month". That is the least useful of the three on its own: a month of five
 * installs reads as growth even when six shops left, and a flat install bar
 * says nothing about how big the install base actually is.
 *
 *   installs   — shops that arrived in that month
 *   uninstalls — shops that left in that month
 *   active     — how many shops were still installed at the END of that month
 *
 * `active` is deliberately a snapshot, not a running total of installs minus
 * uninstalls: it is derived from each shop's own dates, so a shop that
 * installed before the window still counts, and the chart never opens at zero
 * and invents a growth story that did not happen. A month is the half-open
 * interval [start, end), so the last millisecond of a month is never lost.
 *
 * Pure — `now` is a parameter, never `Date.now()` (@rules/core.md).
