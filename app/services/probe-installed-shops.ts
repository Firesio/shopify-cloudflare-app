 *
 * Bounded: at most `PROBE_BATCH_SIZE` shops per tick, least-recently-attempted first, so successive ticks walk the
 * whole fleet without a cursor. One shop at a time (Shopify: "refresh one store at a time"), and each shop is held
 * under a D1 lease so two overlapping ticks can never refresh the same shop concurrently. That lease does NOT stop
 * the Shopify library refreshing the same shop during a merchant request — see docs/shopify-api-invariants.md.
