 * they say so explicitly rather than pretending to work.
 *
 * The moment you add a column holding customer data — an email, a name, a
 * phone, an address, an order line — you MUST extend these handlers to really
 * collect and erase it, and set `implemented: true` in the same change. Shopify
 * rejects apps whose compliance webhooks do not do what they claim, and "it
 * returned 200" is not compliance.
 *
 * Until then both handlers report `implemented: false` and log
 * `….unimplemented`, so a placeholder that has outlived its truth shows up in
 * the logs rather than quietly answering "nothing held" forever.
 *
 * You have 30 days from receipt to complete the action.
