// THE ONLY PLACE APP URLS ARE BUILT.
//
// A link is used from more places than it looks: a route, a redirect, a nav item,
// an email body, a test. Each one that builds its own string is a copy that can
// drift — and a link inside an EMAIL cannot be fixed after it is sent, so a drift
// there is permanent for everyone who already received it.
//
// Pure and client-safe: string building only, no env, no request. Absolute URLs
// take the origin as an argument rather than reading it from configuration,
// because the correct origin is the one the request arrived on (a tunnel in dev,
// the custom domain in production) and nothing here can know that.
