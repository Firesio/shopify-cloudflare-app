/**
 * Record (or revive) an install the moment a shop gets a session.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE A `shops` ROW IS EVER CREATED, and it has to be,
 * because this app never runs the OAuth callback. `@shopify/shopify-app-react-router`
 * v2 and v3 ship exactly two auth strategies — token exchange and merchant-custom-app
 * — and with `AppDistribution.AppStore` it always picks token exchange
 * (`shopify-app.mjs`). Installation is Shopify-managed and the access token is
 * minted inside `authenticate.admin` on the first embedded page load, so
 * `/auth/callback` is never part of the install path. Recording the install
 * there, as the older auth-code-flow templates do, means it is never recorded
 * at all: the shop authenticates, uses the app, writes tickets — and `shops`
 * stays empty, so the internal console shows no shops and the app's own home
 * page reports the install as missing.
 *
 * The library calls this ONLY when it mints a new session — not on every
 * request — see the `!session || !session.isActive(...)` branch in
 * `strategies/token-exchange.mjs`. Offline tokens expire
 * (`expiringOfflineAccessTokens`), so it fires again on every renewal, which is
 * why `recordInstall` upserts rather than inserts.
 *
 * Because it fires on every renewal, telling the staff "a shop installed" is decided here from what was recorded
 * BEFORE this call (`decideInstallAnnouncement`): only a shop we had no record of, or one that had uninstalled. The
 * Partner-history back-fill never announces — it would flood the staff with every historical install.
 *
 * Exported so the behaviour is testable: `shopifyApp` does not expose its
 * hooks, so a test cannot reach this through the built instance.
