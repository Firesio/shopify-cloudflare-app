 * Turn an event and its payload into the email that will be sent.

 * Its own module rather than an inline closure in `notify.server.ts`, because
 * this is where a real defect lived: `EmailMessage.cc` was declared in `types.ts`
 * and forwarded by the transport, but nothing ever set it — so a merchant's
 * support copy list was validated, capped, stored and displayed, and every
 * copied colleague received nothing. A hop that no test could reach is a hop
 * that quietly stopped working.
 *
 * `cc` arrives ALREADY FILTERED (see `~/notifications/copy-recipients`): opted-out
 * addresses removed, the primary recipient excluded, deduped. This function does
 * not re-decide who may be copied — it only renders and addresses.
