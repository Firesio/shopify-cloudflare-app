/**
 * Short-lived, per-attachment access tokens for `/support/file/:id`.
 *
 * WHY this exists rather than just authenticating the request: an embedded
 * Shopify app authenticates with a session token that only its own `fetch`
 * calls can carry. A plain `<img src="/support/file/…">` inside the admin
 * iframe is a browser subresource request — no `Authorization` header, and no
 * usable cookie — so `authenticate.admin` cannot recognise it and the image
 * never renders. (In the internal console the same URL works, because that
 * surface really does use a session cookie.)
 *
 * So the authorisation moves into the URL. The loader has already proven, with
 * a real session, that this shop owns this attachment; it mints a token saying
 * so, and the file route verifies the token instead of the request.
 *
 * The signed payload is `attachmentId:expiresAt`, so a token is useless for any
 * other attachment and stops working on its own. Pure by signature — the
 * secret and the current time are arguments, never ambient reads
 * (@rules/core.md), which is what makes every branch here testable.
