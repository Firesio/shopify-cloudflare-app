/**
 * What a model must be GOOD at — not which feature uses it.
 *
 * Grouping by CAPABILITY rather than by feature is the point: a new AI surface
 * picks an existing purpose instead of adding another setting, so this list
 * stays short however many features arrive. Each purpose also fails
 * differently, which is exactly why they are not one setting.
 *
 * Three are wired today (`writing` drafts support replies, `summary` triages a
 * thread, `classification` screens inbound mail for spam). The rest are defined because they are the distinctions the CATALOGUE
 * itself makes — tool calling, thinking traces, price, context — so the console
 * can be configured before the feature that needs it exists. The settings page
 * marks which are actually in use, so nobody mistakes a configured purpose for
 * a running one.
