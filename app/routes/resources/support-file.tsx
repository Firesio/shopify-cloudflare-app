/**
 * Streams one support attachment back out of R2.
 *
 * The bucket is private, so this route is the only way to read an attachment,
 * and it authorises TWO different audiences against the same object:
 *
 *   - an internal staff member, whose console really does have a session
 *     cookie, and who may read any shop's attachment; and
 *   - anyone holding a signed token for THIS attachment, which the merchant
 *     thread's loader mints after proving, with a real Shopify session, that
 *     the shop owns it.
 *
 * The second branch is not a convenience. A merchant sees these files as
 * `<img>` and `<video>` inside the Shopify admin iframe, and a browser
 * subresource request carries neither the App Bridge session token nor a
 * usable cookie. Authenticating the request here does not fail cleanly either:
 * `authenticate.admin` answers an unauthenticated embedded request with a
 * **200 HTML bounce page**, which the browser cannot decode as an image — so
 * the thread showed a broken image with its filename instead of the screenshot.
 * Moving the authorisation into the URL is what fixes that.
 *
 * The token names the attachment id inside its signed payload, so moving the id
 * in the URL invalidates it: one merchant still cannot read another's files.
