/**
 * The confirmation shown after an admin action, as one sentence.
 *
 * A plain module rather than `.server.ts`: the COMPONENT renders this, so it
 * has to reach the client bundle. Route-local, beside its route and suffixed,
 * per @rules/architecture.md. Knows nothing about intents — the intent-to-key
 * map lives with the intents, so this stays pure and has no server import.
