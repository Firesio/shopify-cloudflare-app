/**
 * Which models serve which PURPOSE, in the order to try them.
 *
 * A CHAIN rather than one row per purpose, because one model per purpose has
 * two failure modes and no answer to either: it leaves the feature dead when
 * that model misbehaves, and it forces one choice to be simultaneously the
 * cheapest thing that can restate a number and the most capable thing that can
 * hold a conversation. `priority` ascending is the order; 0 is tried first.
 *
 * `healthy` / `lastFailedAt` are written by the runtime, not by an admin. A
 * model that just failed is DEMOTED to the back of its own chain for a recovery
 * window, never dropped — dropping could empty a purpose entirely, and a
 * degraded answer beats no answer.
 *
 * The model id is checked against the catalogue on the way in, which is why the
 * console offers a select. NOT shop-scoped, deliberately, and one of only two
 * tables that are not: which model serves a purpose is OUR operational choice,
 * the same for every merchant and paid for by us. Not a precedent
 * (@rules/core.md).
