 * The port a use case depends on to send a notification.

 * — email included — and this is that seam. It exists for a concrete reason
 * rather than ceremony: an email leaves no database state to assert, so without
 * a port there is no honest way to prove a use case asked for the right one.
 * That is not hypothetical here. `support_staff_reply` was sending with no copy
 * list for as long as the feature existed, and nothing failed, because the only
 * way to observe the request was to read the code.
 *
 * Imports ONLY pure types, so this file stays free of I/O and the fake in
 * `~/test/fake-notifier` needs nothing but an array.
