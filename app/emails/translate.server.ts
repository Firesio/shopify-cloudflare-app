 * request to detect from — the locale travels on the payload instead, captured
 * when the recipient was last in front of us.
 *
 * `negotiateLocale` narrows first: Shopify sends regional tags like `es-ES`, and a
 * strict lookup on one would silently fall back to English for a Spanish
 * merchant (@rules/i18n.md). An absent locale is the app default, which is the
 * honest answer for a ticket opened before we recorded one.
