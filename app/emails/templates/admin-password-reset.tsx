 * One builder per notification: a thin JSX composition over the shared layout.
 * Copy lives here; structure lives in `layout.tsx`.

 * Pure apart from rendering — no `getEnv()`, no database, no clock. Everything it
 * needs arrives on the payload, which is what makes it renderable in a test with
 * no request context.
 * STAFF-FACING, so English by this app's choice (@rules/i18n.md). Only the
 * merchant-facing template (support-staff-reply) is translated.
