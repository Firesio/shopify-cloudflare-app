 * Merchant-facing: we answered their ticket.

 * The excerpt is included rather than only a link, because a merchant checking
 * mail on a phone can often read the whole answer without opening the admin at
 * all — and the ones who do need to reply have the link.
 *
 * TRANSLATED, unlike the two staff-facing templates beside it. This is the one
 * email in the app a merchant reads, so @rules/i18n.md applies in full: it used
 * to be hardcoded English even though the payload already carried `locale`,
 * which meant a Spanish merchant asked a question in Spanish and got answered
 * in English.
